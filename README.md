# About this repo
This is a repo for a chalk talk on message passing methods on complex networks and their applications to percolation, presented on April 8th, 2025, in our group meeting. You can find the slides I used for my presentation as well as a Jupyter Notebook file for some hands-on experience.

# Note
The main body of the tutorial notebook comes from [Filippo's tutorial notebook](https://github.com/filrad/Percolation-on-complex-networks). I am planning to update this repo including other advanced message passing methods in percolation studies on complex networks.
